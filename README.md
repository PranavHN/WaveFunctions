Simple plots of quantum-y things in python, part of PHAS0004: Atoms, Stars and the Universe at UCL

Currently there is only one notebook in this repository and it just contains an example of plotting wavefunctions, probability distribtuions and wave-packets.

There are two simple ways of launching the notebook, you can either use Google Colab or Binder. Alternatively you can download the notebook and run it on your local machine.
