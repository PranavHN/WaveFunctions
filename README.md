Simple plots of quantum-y things in python, part of PHAS0004: Atoms, Stars and the Universe at UCL

Currently there is only one notebook in this repository and it just contains an example of plotting wavefunctions, probability distribtuions and wave-packets.

There is currently only one simple way of launching the notebook and it requires access to Google Colab.
